# Concepts - Kiro Specs Documentation

Specs bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details, ensuring alignment and reducing development iterations. Kiro generates three key files that form the foundation of each specification:

*   **requirements.md** - Captures user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation
*   **design.md** - Documents technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
*   **tasks.md** - Provides a detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks

## Workflow

The workflow follows a logical progression with decision points between phases, ensuring each step is properly completed before moving to the next.

*   **Requirements Phase** (leftmost section): Define user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation
*   **Design Phase** (second section): Document the technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
*   **Implementation Planning** (third section): Break down the work into discrete, trackable tasks with clear descriptions and outcomes
*   **Execution Phase** (rightmost section): Track progress as tasks are completed, with the ability to update and refine the spec as needed

## Requirements

The `requirements.md` file is written in the form of user stories and acceptance criteria using structured EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) notation. This ensures that requirements are clear, testable, and unambiguous.

Requirements capture the "what" and "why" of a feature, focusing on user needs and business value rather than implementation details. They serve as the foundation for all subsequent design and implementation decisions.

## Design

The `design.md` file documents the technical architecture and implementation approach. It includes:

- System architecture and component interactions
- Sequence diagrams showing process flows
- Technical considerations and constraints
- Implementation strategies and patterns

The design file is a great place to capture the big picture of how the system will work, including the components and their interactions.

## Implementation Plan

The `tasks.md` file is where you provide a detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks and sub-tasks. Each task is clearly defined, with a clear description, expected outcome, and any necessary resources or dependencies. Kiro's specs offer a structured approach to implementation plans, making it easier to understand and collaborate on complex systems.

Kiro provides a task execution interface for `tasks.md` files that displays real-time status updates. Tasks are updated as in-progress or completed, allowing you to efficiently track implementation progress and maintain an up-to-date view of your development status.
