description: Automatically create or update HOW_KIRO_WAS_USED.md documentation whenever .kiro configuration files are modified
---
Create or update the `PITCH/HOW_KIRO_WAS_USED.txt` file to document how Kiro AI was used in this project. Analyze .kiro/specs/, .kiro/hooks/, and .kiro/steering/ directories. Keep the summary to 500 characters maximum. Use plain text only, no markdown formatting. Focus on key Kiro features used, development workflow improvements, and time savings.
