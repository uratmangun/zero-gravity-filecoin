Analyze the project structure and codebase to create or update a comprehensive `PITCH/DEVPOST.md`, file that answers these questions:

## Inspiration
## What it does
## How we built it
## Challenges we ran into
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
## What we learned
## What's next for Untitled
## Built with
## Project Name(60 characters max)
## Elevator pitch(200 characters max)

Based on the file structure, this appears to be a React/TypeScript application with Supabase backend for course management. Examine the components, database migrations, and overall architecture to craft a compelling project story that highlights the technical achievements and user value proposition.
